## Full Papers

**Understanding the Effect of In-Video Prompting on Learners and Instructors**\
Hyungyu Shin, Eun Young Ko, Joseph Jay Williams, Juho Kim.\
_Tuesday 9am @ 517D: Learning and Training_\
"With in-video prompting, learners answer reflective questions
while watching videos. What do learners and instructors think about it? How can we design a meaningful learning experience for learners while giving valuable feedback to instructors?"

**Enhancing Online Problems Through Instructor-Centered Tools for Randomized Experiments**\
Joseph Jay Williams, Anna Rafferty, Dustin Tingley, Andrew Ang, Walter Lasecki, Juho Kim\
_Tuesday 11am @ 518C: Automated and Crowd Supports for Learning_\
"Most online instructors lack the expertise and tools to design and run experiments. DynamicProblem helps online instructors to author randomized experiments on explanations, hints, feedback messages, etc. with a simple UI & interpretable machine learning."

**Collaborative Dynamic Queries: Supporting Distributed Small Group Decision-making**\
Sungsoo (Ray) Hong, Minhyang (Mia) Suh, Nathalie Henry Riche, Jooyoung Lee, Juho Kim, Mark Zachry\
_Tuesday 2pm @ 516C: Distributed Work_\
"In small group decision making, what if everyone's preferences on decision criteria are easily collected, shared, and filtered? Meet Collaborative Dynamic Queries (CDQ), a UI componenet that improves communication effectiveness & efficiency."

**BebeCode: Collaborative Child Development Tracking System**\
Seokwoo Song, Juho Kim, Bumsoo Kang, Wonjeong Park, John Kim\
_Wednesday 9am @ 518AB: Children, Well-being, and Play_\
"Child development tracking often relies on a single parent's responses. BebeCode is a mobile app for parents and caregivers to collaboratively gather responses, discuss, & resolve conflicts."

**ConceptScape: Collaborative Concept Mapping for Video Learning**\
Ching Liu, Juho Kim, Hao-Chuan Wang. **Honourable Mention Award**.\
_Wednesday 2pm @ 517D: Learning 2_\
"What if a concept map was shown alongside an online learning video to support navigation and comprehension? ConceptScape is a concept-based video player that crowdsources generation of concept maps with expert-level quality."

**RecipeScape: An Interactive Tool for Analyzing Cooking Instructions at Scale**\
Minsuk Chang, Leonore Guillain, Hyeungshik Jung, Vivian Hare, Juho Kim, Maneesh Agrawala.\
_Thursday 9am @ 516E: Crowdsourcing, Data Mining, Dealing with Information_\
"What can we learn from analyzing hundreds of chocolate chip cookie recipes, which are diverse & naturally crowdsourced approaches toward a shared goal? Average or exotic recipe? Fundamentally different ways of making chocolate chip cookies?"

**To Distort or Not to Distort: Distance Cartograms in the Wild**\
Sungsoo (Ray) Hong, Minjoon Yoo, Bonnie Chinh, Amy Han, Sarah Battersby, Juho Kim\
_Thursday 2pm @ 518C: Visualization of Space and Shape_\
"What if your map is rendered based on travel time rather than distance? How does this 'distorted map' affect users' location decision making experience when used in the wild?"

## Late-Breaking-Work

**Exprgram: A Language Learning Interface for Mastering Pragmatic Competence**\
Kyungje Jo, John Joon Young Chung, Juho Kim.\
_LBW057. Tuesday 10:20-11:00 & 15:20-16:00 @ 220BC Exhibit Hall_\
"For language learners, speaking in a contextually appropriate manner is extremely difficult. Exprgram turns to large-scale online videos for their rich & diverse contexts. Learners collaboratively submit & practice alternative expressions for the given context."
